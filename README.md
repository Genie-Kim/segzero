Overview of Seg-Zero:

<div align=center>

</div>

Seg-Zero demonstrates following features:
1. Seg-Zero exhibits emergent test-time reasoning ability. It generates a reasoning chain before producing the final segmentation mask. 
2. Seg-Zero is trained exclusively using reinforcement learning, without any explicit supervised reasoning data.
3. Compared to supervised fine-tuning, our Seg-Zero achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain data.

**Highlight Code Features**:
1. This code is based on the [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1) and [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), which supports model split during sampling and is more GPU memory friendly.
2. Supporting both Qwen2-VL and Qwen2.5-VL series models.
3. Already implementing commonly used rewards in Object Detection and Object Segmentation, including IoU reward and L1 reward.

## Model
<div align=center>

</div>

Seg-Zero employs a decoupled architecture, including a reasoning model and segmentation model. We manually design a sophiscated reward mechanism that integrates both the format and accuracy rewards.


## Examples

</div>


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dvlab-research/Seg-Zero.git
cd Seg-Zero
conda create -n seg_zero python=3.11
conda activate seg_zero
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1
pip install -e .
pip install sam2
pip install matplotlib
```


## Inference
```bash
python inference_scripts/infer.py
```
The default question is 
> "the unusal object in the image."

You will get the thinking process in command line, like:

> "The image shows a bicycle with wheels that have been replaced with large, round objects resembling watermelon slices. The unusual aspect of the image is the substitution of the bicycle wheels with these watermelon-like objects, which is not a typical feature of a bicycle. The rest of the bicycle appears to be a standard design, but the wheels are the focal point of the image."

And the mask will be presented in **inference_scripts** folder.

</div>

You can also provide your own image_path and text by:
```bash
python inference_scripts/infer.py --image_path "your_image_path" --text "your question text"
```


## Training

### 1. GRPO Training

```bash
bash training_scripts/run_qwen2_5_3b_refCOCOg.sh
```
You can try change the following hyper-parameters if you have a large GPU memory.
```bash
worker.actor.micro_batch_size_per_device_for_update=4 or 8 or 16 \
worker.actor.micro_batch_size_per_device_for_experience=4 or 8 or 16 \
```
If your GPU has less memory, you can change the following config. The number is depend on your GPU memory.
```bash
worker.rollout.tensor_parallel_size=[your number between 1-8]
worker.rollout.gpu_memory_utilization=[your number between 0-1]
worker.rollout.n=[your number between 4-32]
```

### 2. Merge Checkpoint in Hugging Face Format

```bash
python3 training_scripts/model_merger.py --local_dir [path_to_your_actor_checkpoint]
```

## The GRPO Algorithm

<div align=center>
<img width="48%" src="assets/rl_sample.png"/>
</div>

Seg-Zero generates several samples, calculates the rewards and then optimizes towards samples that achieve higher rewards.
